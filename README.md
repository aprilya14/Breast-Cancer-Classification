# Breast-Cancer-Classification
Breast Cancer Classification with Decision Tree This project demonstrates a simple yet effective implementation of a machine learning classification model for predicting breast cancer diagnoses using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify whether a tumor is malignant (M) or benign (B) based on various physical features of the cell nuclei measured in digitized images. The project leverages the Decision Tree Classifier, which is widely known for its interpretability and effectiveness in handling classification tasks.

Key Features
Dataset:
- The dataset includes 569 samples with 30 numerical features.
- Source: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset (available in scikit-learn).
  
Algorithms and Tools Used:
- Decision Tree Classifier from scikit-learn
- Visualized using matplotlib
- Preprocessing and data handling with pandas and numpy
  
Results:
- Achieved 94.74% accuracy on the test set.
- Clear visualization of the decision-making process using a plotted decision tree.
